# In this advance python, we will learn about how python works behind the scenes and its architecture.

# Just like other programming languages, python also has its own architecture. It has several key components that work together to execute the code.

# Why to learn python architecture?
# It is important to understand the architecture of python to write efficient code and to debug the code easily.
# You'll be able to write optimized code!
# Debugging complex issues will become easier and you will be able to understand the root cause of the issue.
# You'll gain a deeper appreciation of how Python translates your thoughts into machine actions.

# If you learn any language, you should know how it works behind the scenes. It will clear all your concepts and you will be able to write efficient code.

# Basically this advance python will help you clear your basics! How ironic it is!

# There are many components in python architecture like source code, interpreter, compiler, standard libraries, etc. We will be discussing them one by one in detail.

# I am sorry to tell you that this whole advance python is theoretical and it will take a lot of time to understand it. So, be patient and read it carefully.

# There are many deep concepts in this advance python. So, I will try to explain them in the simplest way possible. So, be with me and give your best!
