// While working with node js, we are going to use so many third party libraries/packages.
// We use npm to install these packages.

// What is npm?
// npm stands for Node Package Manager.
// It is both a command line tool and an online repository for node js packages/modules.
// The npm command line tool is automatically installed when node js is installed.
// We can use this tool to install, remove, update and manage the packages.

// From where we can get the packages?
// We can get the packages from npm registry. It is a public collection of packages of open-source code for node js, front-end web apps, mobile apps, robots, routers, and countless other needs of the JavaScript community.

// The site for npm registry is https://www.npmjs.com/
// The npm registry site is the largest public software registry in the world. It has over 1.3 million packages of open-source code.
// Example: In the upcoming chapters, we are going to use a package called express which is also known as express.js. It is a web application framework for node js. We can install it using npm.
// The express package is available at this npm registry site. We can search for it and install it using npm.

// Lets go on the npm registry site and search for express package and press enter.
// We can see the express package here. We can click on it to see the details of the package.
// You can see all the details of the package here. We can see the version, description, keywords, and much more.
// You can even see the weekly downloads of the package. You can see the number of weekly downloads of the package express here, latest version, and the license of the package.
// You can even see how to use the package express here.
// You can even see the commands to install the package express here.

// npm is not only used in node js but also in entire JavaScript ecosystem. If you are using react js or any other js framework, you will still use npm to install the packages.

// Just search for react and you can see the react package here.

// For using npm in our command line, we just need to open the terminal and type npm and press enter.
// For viewing the version of npm, we can type npm -v and press enter.


// Whenever we create a new project, the first thing we do it is to create a configuration file called package.json.
// Package.json is a file that gives the necessary information to npm which allows it to identify the project as well as handle the project's dependencies.

// To create a package.json file, we can use the command npm init and press enter.
// It will ask for the package name, version, description, entry point, test command, git repository, keywords, author, license.
// We can fill in the details and press enter.
// We can see the package.json file created in the project folder.

// We can also create a package.json file using the command npm init -y. It will create a package.json file with default values.


// Task 1
// Create a package.json file using npm init command.

// Task 2
// Create a package.json file using npm init -y command.
