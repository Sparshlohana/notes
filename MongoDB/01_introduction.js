// What is MongoDb?
// MongoDB is a document-oriented database solution, which we use for high volume data storage.
// MongoDB is fast and efficient database solution because of the way we store the data.

// Unlike traditional databases like SQL, mysql, oracle, etc. MongoDB does not store data in tables. Instead, it stores data in collections and documents.
